            Welcome to my blog page.
        </h1>
        <p>
            Hello. This is Jash Thakkar & welcome to my blog page. I will be sharing my Journey with you all. First, I will express my journey of coding & then how did I managed to do coding in 10<sup>th</sup> class.<br><br>
            So, Intially, I was in 5<sup>th</sup> Class & we were brought into our school's computer lab for practical. At that time, I was just running a simple Html code of Hello world & other basic things. My school had taken IT code 165 [Now CA(Computer Applications) code 165]. At That time, I didn't even think that I will code these type of websites in future.
            Then skipping it to class 8<sup>th</sup>. We were said to run basic python codes & Html website with more High level tags at that level. Then, The famous COVID-19 Lockdown came in March 2020 which held everyone at their homes. At that time, I thought to myself to <strong>do coding</strong> as it was just a thing of <strong>Passive Passion & timepass</strong> for me. I actually did study in 9th & got around 91%. I really don't know about my 10<sup>th</sup> percentage but in Term 1 exam, I got around 94%. Now, I tried to learn coding online but I was not able to understand better. So, I searched through Books that I had at my home and I learnt HTML & other programming languages from there. For clearence - HTML AND CSS - is not a CODING LANGUAGE & it is instead a software that is used to design websites like these.
            I, then tried sololearn, but it was rather a text-based theory with questions that are connected with the given theory like the Case-Based/passage-based Question given in Languages like english in Board Papers. I also tried some other websites for references like geeksforgeeks.com or w3school.org for learning CSS & javascript. The website you are seeing is made purely by me leaving that the home page is inspired by a YouTube coder. (I will link it down in credits section). I have done some projects for web designing but intially I was kinda losing interest in coding as it was like a exam with the little known theory at the time of learning. After my 9<sup>th</sup> class, I started my 10<sup>th</sup> class with full determination, but the announcement of CBSE in June 2021 said that there were 2 Terms as a board exam. Suprisingly, I had done my Term 1 syllabus by the announcement of the term 1 & term 2 exam. So, I did started my simple coding as usual.<br/><br>
            <br>Then, I thought of doing a website like this in july-august month. But unfortunately, I left my coding & Youtube in the month of september as I was having Term 1 exam from 30<sup>th</sup> november. Till september, I had coded my website skeletically (like the basic attributes to the syntax & which syntax to use where in website). My Term 1 exams were good enough & I earned better marks in it. After December 11<sup>th</sup>, I took a break of 2 days & started my Term 2 preparations as at that time, it was assumed the boards to be scheduled at 15<sup>th</sup>march but instead, CBSE announced the Term 2 exam from 26<sup>th</sup> April. I, then, Took some coding & completed my website at almost 80% but the Term 2 exams were near, so I had to quit coding. Now, after 14<sup>th</sup> of may, I am completing my website at full pace as I will have the concepts of HTML & CSS in exam. Just the difference is that, we have to write it descriptively.
            I have tried to complete this website before 19th of May so that I can focus on my IT 165 (CA 165) Exam which is to be held on 23<sup>rd</sup> of May. After that, I will upload my website to a hosting server. I will also make a video about my website & upload it on YouTube. This was how my passive passion & a thing of timepass has lead me to make this website. I honestly don't think that I will do coding as a career and I will rather take up the Automation [IOT] & Robotics.<br><br>This was how my website was made and how did I manage to make one.
